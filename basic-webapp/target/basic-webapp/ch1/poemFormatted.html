    <p>
      Roses are red<br>
      Violets are blue<br>
      This could be a poem<br>
      But not a haiku<br>
    <p>
      A haiku has a xed structure. The rst line has ve
      syllables, the second line has seven syllables and the
      third line has ve syllables. Therefore, the previous
      poem cannot be a haiku.
